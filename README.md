# Quality of Life Changes
All of these features must be enabled in the config menu before you can use them.

## Features:
### Vanilla Friendly
These features don't meaningfully change the gameplay of Outer Wilds.
* **Disable Time-Freezing during Dialogue at a Certain Location**
  * There's an option in the vanilla game settings to freeze time while talking to characters. This can help make sure that you don't have to rush while talking to characters, but there's a certain location where that doesn't exactly matter. Enable this feature to disable time-freezing at that location!
* **Disable the Reticule (the dot in the middle of the screen)**
  * This reticule can be set to visible (default), invisible unless the Scout Launcher is equipped, or always invisible.
* **Disable Scout Launcher being automatically equipped**

### Non-Vanilla-Friendly
These features change some aspect of gameplay for Outer Wilds that alters the experience.
* **Press 'Cancel' button to Exit Dialogue**
  * Do you want that character you're talking to to just *stop talking* so you can leave? Press the 'Cancel' button (usually Q on keyboard or B on gamepad) to exit a dialogue tree immediately!
* **Eyes Always Glow**
  * Makes a certain type of eye always glow, even if you're not shining a light into it.
