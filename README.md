# Quality of Life Changes

## Features:
### Vanilla Friendly
These features just change a few things that don't really affect gameplay but feel good to have. These are **enabled** by default.
* **Disable Time-Freezing during Dialogue at a Certain Location**
  * There's an option in the vanilla game settings to freeze time while talking to characters. This can help make sure that you don't have to rush while talking to characters, but there's a certain location where that doesn't exactly matter. Enable this feature to disable time-freezing at that location!
* **Contextual Reticle**
  * You can fully disable the reticle or have it only show up when you're using a tool.
* **Disable Scout Launcher being automatically equipped**

### Non-Vanilla-Friendly
These features change some aspect of gameplay for Outer Wilds that alters the experience. They are **disabled** by default.
* **Press 'Cancel' button to Exit Dialogue**
  * Press the 'Cancel' button (usually Q on keyboard or B on gamepad) to exit a dialogue tree immediately!
* **Eyes Always Glow**
  * Makes a certain type of eye always glow, even if you're not shining a light into it.
* **Toggle Helmet**
    * Allows you to take off or put on your helmet by pressing H, but be careful! Taking off your helmet in space be fatal.
* **Manually Equip Translator**
  * Allows you to equip the translator whenever you want.
